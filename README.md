# StockPricePrediction
Realtime stock price prediction using Reinforcement Learning

This project tries to predict the stock prices for the next day given the open, close, high and low prices of the stock today. 
The project uses Reinforcement Learning to predict the prices and optimize for the long term reward rather than a short term reward.
